What is dynamic website?
1. Changing the elements on the website once the website is loaded
2. Actually calculating the sum based on the ips and rendering it on the screen


Throttling and debouncing
Ignoring requests on backend is throttling
Delaying and sending only updated requests from frontend is debouncing

eg: go and type in amazon search bar , if u type slow it keeps giving suggestions i.e, backend calls are made but if we type fast then no suggestions until we take a small pause i.e, back end calls are delayed 

<input type="number" id="ip1" oninput="backendCallFunc()"><br><br>
<input type="number" id="ip2" oninput="backendCallFunc()"><br><br>

this may cause too many unneccsary backend calls


<input type="number" id="ip1" oninput="debounceBackendCallFunc()"><br><br>
<input type="number" id="ip2" oninput="debounceBackendCallFunc()"><br><br>

let prev;
function debounceBackendCallFunc(){
    clearTimeout(prev)
    prev=setTimeout(backendCallFunc(),100);
}


what to do with state received from backend??
compare the new state with the previous state , check the difference and then update the dom accordingly. Till now what we did was to clear the dom and then create a new dom but this isn't efficient.
